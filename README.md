# ELISA-Hyperskill
This is "ELISA Hyperskill" project form Hyperskill.<br>
In this project, you will learn how to apply Python in bioinformatics. Analyzing experimental data is essential for every biologist, as understanding and processing the results can help derive insights from a conducted experiment. You will learn how to obtain protein concentrations from an ELISA experiment! Ultimately, you will have a Python function to get concentrations from raw data files automatically.<br>
Nowadays, automatization is a critical process in almost any field of research, including immunoproteomics. It helps with big datasets of unprocessed sample signals after the ELISA tests. Using experimental data files, you will write a function that automatizes obtaining measured protein concentrations after an ELISA test.<br>
Note: This repository contains all files from Hyperskill for evaluating each step of the project and quizes and etc.<br>
