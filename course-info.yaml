summary: "<div>\r\n<p>Nowadays, automatization is a critical process in almost any\
  \ field of research, including immunoproteomics. It helps with big datasets of unprocessed\
  \ sample signals after the ELISA tests. Using experimental data files, you will\
  \ write a function that automatizes obtaining measured protein concentrations after\
  \ an ELISA test.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br>\r\n\_</p>\r\n</div><br/><br/>Learn more at <a\
